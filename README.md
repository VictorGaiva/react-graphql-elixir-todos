# Todos React, GraphQL and Elixir  

## Project description
This is my attempt at following [Make Programming Fun Again's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW_YiVuoo-WG0bxQElVgxAg) video series on implementing a React+GraphQL+Elixir Todo Web App. The playlist com be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MCmTiB3g6c&list=PLbYBXKy2Fbj8E3Zfo0_uVGVmMWNQxh5H3).

I follow each episode and then extend the app with more functionalities that are yet to be defined.
